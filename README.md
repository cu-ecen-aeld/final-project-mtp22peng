An Hello module is built based on the project: https://github.com/mtp22peng/hello-yocto

The project follows the linux module building guidelines, and create a hello-module layer with appropriate recipes so that an image is aimed at beaglebone hardware. In the embedded OS, the "modprobe" command is used to install or remove the module. If successful, the print subroutines inside the entry or exit module calls will print the correct lines.
